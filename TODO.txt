Web server stuff:

Actual arb calc. stuff:
    - investigate if 0.35's are actually 0.35's
        -currency shit?

    - partition bookies into 2-outcome and 3-outcome bookies
        - for instance:
            - at the moment, if have majority 2-outcome bookies,
            but some 3-outcome bookies, just ignore the 3-outcomes
            - want to use them

    - every time do a sports search:
        - set all current sports to false
        - go through each sport and set to true in db
            - those remaining will be false

    - can probably abstract idea of an 'arb' into a class

    - investigate the following optimisation
        - there's an end-point 'GET event odds' that allows 
        you to query one game
            - can re-query games and update evs for individual 
            arbs as needed
