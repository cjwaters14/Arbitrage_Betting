## NOTE: below is the JSON structure of a game ##

Some back of envelope math for API costs:

    NOTE: define 'whole run' as:
        -checking for arbs in each of the 5 markets for each of the app. 40 sports

    -5 markets per request
    -app. 40 sports

    -so 5*40 = 200 requests per run

    -at 20,000 req/mth allowed, 100 whole runs per month == app. 3 changes per day

    -so, remains to be seen if 3 requests per day is enough
        -if it is, cool

        -if it isn't, might have to figure out some funky stuff 
            -ie: figure out which markets are best for us
